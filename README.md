# Deep Learning Coursera Specialization
This repo contains interesting project assignments I have done during the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG. I find this specialization as a nice way to connect and repeat things learned during my studies.

## Official Description
In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach. 

## Description
The full specialization contains 5 modules, where most of them have project assignments.
